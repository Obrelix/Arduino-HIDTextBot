# Arduino-HIDTextBot
Arduino-HIDTextBot turns a USB-HID capable Arduino (e.g., Leonardo/Micro/Pro Micro) into a “text bot” that types randomized pre-defined phrases (with human-like typos and corrections) and occasionally triggers small mouse activity. It can also move the mouse cursor in geometric paths.
